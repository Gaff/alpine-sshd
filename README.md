# alpine-sshd

Minimal Alpine Linux Docker container with `sshd` exposed and `rsync` installed. This uses the excellent [alpine-base][smebbersonalpinebase] with [s6-overlay][s6-overlay]. This means
the image will correctly log, handle errors, and do other things that you'd expect a base image to be capable of.

Mount your .ssh credentials at `/root/.ssh/` in order to access the container via root ssh.
Alternatively pass in your key via the AUTHORIZED_KEY env variable.

## Usage Example

```
docker run --rm -it -p 2222:22 -v ~/my_ssh_keys:/root/.ssh/ gaff/alpine-sshd
```

```
docker run --rm -it -p 2222:22 -e AUTHORIZED_KEY="`cat authorized_keys`" gaff/alpine-sshd
```
